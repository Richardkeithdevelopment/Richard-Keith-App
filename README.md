# Starting Theme for SvelteKit with Prismic, Tailwind, Netlify & Custom Built Components
- This theme uses Sveltekit as JS-framework
- Prismic as CMS
- TailwindCSS as CSS-framework
- Netlify to deploy the website
- Library of custom components

## Setting up Prismic
Prismic is an easy to use CMS which has a free plan for developers and small projects.
You can set up an account here: [Prismic](https://prismic.io/)


### Create pages in Prismic
Once you have your account you should **create the folllowing pages**.

**Do not yet create any fields. We will get back to that later.**

- Home
   - **Single Page**
   - Will be the front page of your website.

- Setup
   - **Single Page**
   - Will hold general information which can be accessed all over the website. For example a navigation, the SEO image or textâ€¦

- Page
   - **Repeating Page**
   - This is a template which will used for all pages which are not projects, products or blog posts.
   - It contains a slice field which lets you click together website content from already built components. You can compare it with the **ACF Flexible Content** field which we know from Wordpress.

- Projects
   - **Single Page**
   - Has a list which allows you to sort the projects.

- Project
   - **Repeating Page**
   - This is the page which serves as template for all projects.

- Products (Optional)
   - **Single Page**
   - Has a list which allows you to sort the projects.
   - This is exactly the same page like the **Projects** page. It just links to products instead.
   - No need to create this page, if you do not want to use a shop.

- Product (Optional)
   - **Repeating Page**
   - This is the page which serves as template for all projects.
   - This is exactly the same page like the **Project** page. It just holds product information instead.
   - No need to create this page, if you do not want to use a shop.


Now you have all the pages.

### Create the fields in Prismic

This can be a tiring process.

But fortunately Prismic allows us to copy and paste the fields as JSON file into each page.

In the folder [masks](masks) are JSON files which you need.

Each file contains the fields of one page in Prismic.

You can copy and paste the content of such a file into the JSON section on a prismic page.

Then the fields will be generated in the backend and are ready to be filled. Awesome!

Now we have all the pages with all the fields which we need.

Feel free to add more fields or pages in the future. This here is only a starting point for a website.

### Add some basic content into Prismic

Just upload some images and texts and play around with it a bit.
Like this we can check if everything worked, once we connect and run SvelteKit.

You will notice that there is **slice section** in the Pages page. No need to use it now. We will also get back to that later.

## Setting up SvelteKit

### Install SvelteKit
Now it is time to set up SvelteKit. This is super easy. Just run the npm install.
```
npm install
```

### Connect Prismic
Then set up the connection to Prismic.

Because your Prismic account is not private, we do not need a token and can just access it with linking to the public API.

Change the api-endpoint to your own in this file [client.js](src/utils/client.js) to something like this 'https://YOUR-PRISMIC-URL.cdn.prismic.io/api/v2'.

### Run the website
If you now run npm run dev, you should see the website running!
```
npm run dev
```

## Connect to Netlify
In this repository, things re set up that you can deploy the website easily on Netlify.
This took me quite some time because it was not clear which dependencies I needed to install.
Nothing to worry about. It should just work.

## Structure of SvelteKit
There are two main folders for you when you develop this website.

Both are in the [src](src) folder.

1. [Routes](src/routes)
You should know the basics of how to use SvelteKit, so I will not go too deep inside.

For each page in Prismic is a template file.

### index.svelte
[index.svelte](src/routes/index.svelte): This is the welcome page and is connected to the **home** page in Prismic

It is also connected to the **setup** page in Prismic to get the data of the navigation. It is also possible to include the navigation globally in the [__layout.svelte](src/routes/__layout.svelte). But to have more control, I put the navigation into each page.

### projects.svelte
[products.svelte](src/routes/projects.svelte): This is the page which get the content (in this case the list of posts) from Prismic.

The cool thing here is that you can just copy and paste this page and call it **products.svelte**.
Then you only need to change the
```
const type = 'project'
```
to
```
const type = 'product'
```
and it is conneced to the products page.
